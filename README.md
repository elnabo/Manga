[WIP] Manage your manga with a DRM free fan-made copy


You need to use my fork of waxe to make it works: https://github.com/elnabo/waxe

To compile to cpp you have to change sys.db.Object & sys.db.Manager
according to this page https://github.com/elnabo/Manga/wiki/Compiling-to-cpp.

Note: You do not have the right to download a manga that you do not own.
